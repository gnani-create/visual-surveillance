Step 0:Install Prerequisites
1)Install Python
2)Install Required Libraries(requirements1.txt)


Step 1: Setup Database

1)Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
2)Create a database named face_recognizer.
3)Create necessary tables (criminal and recognitions) using your database schema.
4)Update the connection credentials in the code (host, username, password) where necessary.


Step 2: Image and Data Directory

1)Place the images and data in the correct directories:
2)Update image paths in main.py and face_recognition.py.
3)Ensure images are accessible at the mentioned paths.
4)Confirm the data directory in train.py:


Step 3: Train the Model

1)Run train.py:
2)Ensure a classifier.xml is created, which is essential for face recognition.

Step 4: Launch the Application

1)Start the main application using:python main.py,The interface will display options like:
Criminal Details: Manage criminal records.
Face Detector: Start real-time face recognition.
Train Data: Re-train the model using new images.
Last Visited: View recently identified criminals.

âœ… Step 5: Troubleshooting Tips
1)If the camera is not detected, ensure it is properly connected and not in use by other applications.
2)If you face database errors, validate your MySQL connection and database schema.
3)Verify haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml exists in the working directory for face detection.
